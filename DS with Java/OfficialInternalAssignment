Design data structure to store telephone directory of phone users.
For every user, following information should be stored:
1. Name
2. Address
3. Phone number

Data structure should permit following operations.
1. Add information about a user.
2. Delete user information.
3. Search a user based on phone number. ( Since no two user can have the same phone number, this search should return information about one user, if phone number exists )
4. Search a user based on name. ( Since multiple users can have same name, this search can return multiple values ).

There will be more search operations as compared to add and delete operations, hence, appropriate data structure and algorithm should be used that optimise for efficient search operations.



Marks distribution:
1. Design of data structure - 4 Marks.
2. Explain the reason for choosing the data structure and how do it help in optimising for fast search, based on phone number and name. - 2 Marks.
3. State the time complexity of add and search operations - 1 Mark.
4. Implementation of the system - 3 Marks.
5. Correctness of output - 3 Marks.
6. Error handling - 2 Marks.
