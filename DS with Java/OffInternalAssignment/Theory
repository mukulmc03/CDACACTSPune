1. Design of data structure. 
	
	I have used Array data structure to solve this assignment, because array has simple mechanism.
	I have used 3 linked - arrays to store name, number & address.


2. Explain the reason for choosing the data structure and how do it help in optimising for fast search, based on phone number and name.

	I chose array as it is simple to implement and easy to manage. It uses linear search approach to search elements based on phone number & name.


3. State the time complexity of add and search operations.

	Time complexity of Data Structure implemented in the system is as follows : 

		Worst-case performance	O(n)
		Best-case performance	O(1)
		Average performance		O(n/2)
