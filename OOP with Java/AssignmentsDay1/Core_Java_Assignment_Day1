Day 1
1. Please solve the following assignment without IDE (to revise java app development , packages n classpath)
2. Extract javadocs & open index.html in your browser
3. Create Point class Point2D , under package com.app.geometry   : for representing a point in x-y co-ordinate system.
eg : day1_lab \src 
com \ app \geometry --- Point2D.java
package com.app.geometry;

3.1 Create a parameterized constructor to accept x & y co-ords.

3.2 Add public String getDetails()) --to return string form point's x & y co-ords

3.3 Add isEqual method to Point2D class : boolean returning method : must return true if both points are having same x,y co-ords or false otherwise. 
eg : boolean isEqual(Point2D anotherPoint){....}

3.4 Add a method to Point2D class -- to create and return new point having given x & y offset.
eg : Point2D p1=new Point2D(10,20);
Point2d p3=p1.createNewPoint(5,-2);//p3 : 15,18
If user supplies offset of (5, -2) : your method should return a new point object placed at (15,18)
eg : Point2D createNewPoint(int xOff,iny yOff){...}

3.5 Add calculateDistance method to calculate distance between current point & specified point & return the distance to the caller.
(eg double  calcDistance(Point2D p2))
Hint : Use distance formula . Use java.lang.Math class methods --sqrt, pow etc.

3.6 Write TestPoint class , under "com.app.tester" package with a main method
Accept co ordinates of 2 points from user (Scanner) --p1 & p2

3.7 Use getDetails method to display point details.(p1's details & p2's details)

3.8 Invoke isEqual & display if points are same or different (i.e p1 & p2 are located at the same position)

3.9 Create new point p3 , with the dimensions offset from p1.
I/P --x offset & y offset

3.10 Display distance between 2 points.(between p1 & p2)
