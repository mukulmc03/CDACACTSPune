Day 10
Continuation of Day 9 assignment , to add validation constraints .
1. Continue with the same customer class.
Unique ID of customer class : email
Override equals method based upon the same.

2. Create custom exception class : CustomerHandlingException , as a checked exception

3. Add following validation rules , in a separate class CustomerValidations, using static validation methods
Don't use method level exc handling , instead delegate exc handling to the caller(main class)
3.1 email must be minimum 8 to max 15 chars long
It should contain "@" n must end in ".com"
Hint : Use String class methods : contains , endsWith

3.2 Password minimum length 6 to 20 & must contain atleast one of the special characters : $ / @
/# /* n must be alpha numeric.

Help : If needed
Use this regular expression : "((?=.*\\d)(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[#@$*]).{6,20})"
& use String class method : matches

3.3 reg amount must be in the multiples of 500

3.4 Duplicate email checking.(Must use equals here)


4. Create a Tester for the following(similar to yesterday)
1. Register new customer
Accept all customer details. In case of a duplicate customer email, or any other validation failures , DO NOT register customer. 
Give suitable error message(via catch block)
Otherwise store customer details.

2. Display all customers , from a specified city
I/P : city name

3. Exit
